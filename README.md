The search gem doesn't do anything yetâ€¦ but it will!

As we speak, the core team is assembling and [you're invited](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHlLTXNERVc2X3Zkc0U4N0FUVTBWV3c6MQ).
From there, we'll decide what exactly what the search gem should do and go about
the business of writing it. It's experimental, but it'll be fun!
